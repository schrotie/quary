BREAKING renamed all *.js to *.mjs since this works better with various tools

Moved demo/todoRedux.html to demo/todoRedux/. It is now a full fledged
Redux application with separated "connector" modules ("containers" in React
lingo), its own package.js, build process and README.md. The README.md is a
tutorial for how to develop full fledged ShadowQuery/Redux web apps.
